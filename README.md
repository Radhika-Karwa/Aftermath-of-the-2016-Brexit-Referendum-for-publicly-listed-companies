# Aftermath-of-the-2016-Brexit-Referendum-for-publicly-listed-companies
# Scope of the project
For the MTP, students are supposed to:

to analyze the performance of British, publicly-listed companies in the aftermath of the 2016 Brexit Referendum. A group of publicly listed companies based in France and Germany will offer the counterfactual data to estimate how British companies could have performed in case of no-leave;
to visually display the insights emerging from the analysis.
Mainly, there are three routes to visually display the results:

adopting descriptive statistical charts (that is, drawing on the tools discussed in week 3 module);
adopting charts that convey the results produced with statistical models such as linear regression (that is, drawing on the tools discussed in week 5 of the module);
going for a combination of the previous two routes.
!!! Notes ¡¡¡: the choice of the route does not affect the mark of the submission. In other words, I do not have any preference for a certain route. In terms of marking, what matters is the set of assessment criteria reported in the README of the repo.

# Target audience
The chart will be included in the next issues of The Economist to complement a commentary written by an economic journalist.

# Data
The data for the project contains:

population of companies
economic & financials (both short- and long-term)

financials__long_term: monthly data-points spanning the years 2014 - 2018
financials__short_term: daily data-points in the vicinity of the Brexit Referendum.
